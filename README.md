# VentFramework (Continued)

## *Note: This repository is the OFFICIAL continuation of Vent Framework due to the original creator passing the project.*

# Information

VentFramework is a library built for Among Us, inspired by the popular library Reactor.

Features:
- Highly robust option system aiming to replace BepIn's builtin configuration
    - Out-of-the-box integration with Among Us's game options
    - Highly configurable rendering for the game options
    - Built-in preset manager for options to allow players to group specific options
- Brand-new localization system that emphasizes easy usability and organization
    - Translations are obtainable statically via attributes or a static method call
- Easy command manager for Among Us chat commands
    - Decorate classes with the command prefix then allow the framework to do all the heavy-lifting
- Super configurable modded handshake support
    - Configure the behavior when modded clients join (Kick, Disable RPC, do nothing)
    - Option syncing between modded clients if your mod deems their version as valid
- Custom RPC attributes with cleaner developmental interface than Reactor
    - Batch interface which allows for objects to be sent across multiple packets
- Loads of new utilities
    - New data structures
        - Batch collection (for automatic sending list of objects with Batch-RPC)
        - An array of "Optional" objects highly influenced by Java Optional API
        - A bunch more
    - Revamped asynchronous methods for running & scheduling code asynchronously
    - Profiling utilities


# Getting Started
Resources for using the framework:
1. [Installation Setup](#installation)
2. [Project Setup](#project-setup)
3. [Custom RPC](#custom-rpc)
4. [Localization](#localization)

# Installation
Whether you are installing VentFramework to use with a mod, or developing with it, the process is the same.
<br/>Make sure these are downloaded and installed in a folder before continuing:
- [Among Us](https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/) - Base Game
- [BepInEx #697](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be) - Required for C# code Injection (without this, the game isn't modded)

Next, you'll need to download VentFramework, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Lotus-AU/VentFramework/releases/latest).<br/>
Mod authors should provide which version of the framework youâ€™ll need. But versions are usually cross-compatible so if confused try downloading the latest.

Once downloaded, move **VentFrameworkContinued.dll** into your Among Us Directory, specifically `BepInEx/Plugins`.<br/>
Once its there, you're good to go!

If you are a developer, make sure to add a reference by nuget package or DLL (preferred).

# Project Setup
Add `BepInDependency` to your main plugin class.
```csharp
using VentLib;

[BepInProcess("AmongUs.exe")]
[BepInDependency(Vents.Id)]
public class MyExample: BasePlugin
```
Additionally, you may add the **VentModFlags** attribute to specify information about your mod.<br/>
If you add the **RequireOnAllClients** flag, then people without the mod can't even find your lobby by inputting the code!

You can also specify a version of your mod. It will be automatically communicated with other clients.<br/>
By default, it will just be `NoVersion`.<br/>
You can either:
- Create versions Manually
- Create versions based on last GitHub commit

We'll cover both ways.

## Manual
This is not as easy to set up as GitHub, but gives you more control as a Developer.
Add the Interface `IVersionEmitter` to your plugin.
```csharp
using VentLib.Version.Git;
using VentLib;

[BepInProcess("AmongUs.exe")]
[BepInDependency(Vents.Id)]
public class MyExample: BasePlugin, IVersionEmitter
```
<br><br/>
Create a class to hold your version.<br/>
This is where you have most control as you can choose what is communicated via rpc.</br>
Here is an example class:
```csharp
using VentLib.Networking;
/// <summary>
/// Version Representing this Mod
/// </summary>
public class ExampleVersion: VentLib.Version.Version
{
    public readonly string Major;
    public readonly string Minor;
    public readonly string Patch;
    
    public ExampleVersion()
    {
        Major = "1";
        Minor = "1";
        Patch = "2";
    }
    
    internal ExampleVersion(MessageReader reader)
    {
        Major = reader.Read<string>();
        Minor = reader.Read<string>();
        Patch = reader.Read<string>();
    }
    
    public override VentLib.Version.Version Read(MessageReader reader) => new ExampleVersion(reader);

    protected override void WriteInfo(MessageWriter writer)
    {
        writer.Write(Major);
        writer.Write(Minor);
        writer.Write(Patch);
    }

    public override string ToSimpleName()
    {
        return $"Example Addon v{Major}.{Minor}.{Patch}";
    }

    public override string ToString() => "ExampleVersion";
}
```
<br><br/>
Create a static Instance and add a **Getter** functon named `Version`.
```csharp
using VentLib.Version;
using VentLib;

[BepInProcess("AmongUs.exe")]
[BepInDependency(Vents.Id)]
public class MyExample: BasePlugin, IVersionEmitter
{
    public readonly ExampleVersion CurrentVersion = new();
    
    public Version Version() => CurrentVersion;
}
```
<br><br/>
VentFramework also allows you to filter through versions and run actions based on them.<br/>
Here is an example:
```csharp
using VentLib.Version;
using VentLib;

[BepInProcess("AmongUs.exe")]
[BepInDependency(Vents.Id)]
public class MyExample: BasePlugin, IVersionEmitter
{
    public readonly ExampleVersion CurrentVersion = new();
    
    public Version Version() => CurrentVersion;
    
    public HandshakeResult HandshakeFilter(Version version)
    {
        if (handshake is NoVersion) return HandshakeResult.FailDoNothing; // Does nothing to the User if vanilla.
        if (handshake is not ExampleVersion exa) return HandshakeResult.DisableRPC; // Disables RPC of the User if they aren't our version.
        if (CurrentVersion.ToSimpleName() != exa.ToSimpleName()) return HandshakeResult.DisableRPC; // They are on different version.
        return HandshakeResult.PassDoNothing;
    }
}
```

## Github
This is the easier way, but you need to have a somewhat understanding of how `git` works.
When committing your final code before release, **add** a tag to the commit that specifies the version.
`git tag -a <tagname> -m "your message"`<br/>
Example: `git tag -a v1.1.2 -m "v1.1.2 Update"`

Future compiles will automatically have your version set to v1.1.2.
Creating tags on the website will not bump your version.

### Setup
Add the Interface `IGitVersionEmitter` to your plugin.
```csharp
using VentLib.Version.Git;
using VentLib;

[BepInProcess("AmongUs.exe")]
[BepInDependency(Vents.Id)]
public class MyExample: BasePlugin, IGitVersionEmitter
```
<br><br/>
Add a GitVersion parameter that automatically initializes.
```csharp
using VentLib.Version.Git;
using VentLib;

[BepInProcess("AmongUs.exe")]
[BepInDependency(Vents.Id)]
public class MyExample: BasePlugin, IGitVersionEmitter
{
    public readonly GitVersion CurrentVersion = new(typeof(MyExample).Assembly);
}
```
<br><br/>
Then, it is the same as adding the HandShake filter function from before.
```csharp
using VentLib.Version.Git;
using VentLib;

[BepInProcess("AmongUs.exe")]
[BepInDependency(Vents.Id)]
public class MyExample: BasePlugin, IGitVersionEmitter
{
    public readonly GitVersion CurrentVersion = new(typeof(MyExample).Assembly);
    
    public GitVersion Version() => CurrentVersion;
    
    public HandshakeResult HandshakeFilter(Version version)
    {
        return HandshakeResult.PassDoNothing;
    }
}
```
<br><br/>
Like before, you can add checks to make sure the version is the same.
```csharp
public HandshakeResult HandshakeFilter(Version version)
{
    if (handshake is NoVersion) return HandshakeResult.FailDoNothing; // Does nothing to the User if they are vanilla.
    if (handshake is not GitVersion git) return HandshakeResult.DisableRPC; // Disables RPC of the User.
    if (CurrentVersion.Sha != git.Sha) return HandshakeResult.DisableRPC; // They are on different commit or another mod.
    return HandshakeResult.PassDoNothing;
}
```
-------------------
However, we still aren't done.<br/>
There are just a few lines of code that we have to do to finish our Version Control.<br/>
Inside the Initializer for your function, we need to register our version.
```csharp
public static VersionControl VersionControl;

public MyExample()
{
    VersionControl versionControl = MyExample.VersionControl = VersionControl.For(this);
}
```
You will want to save an instance to this Version Control as it has useful features like `GetModdedPlayers()`.

You can also add a Postfix for when everything is finalized. Unlike `HandshakeFilter`, this passes in a **PlayerControl** which allows you to enact actions on the player.
```csharp
public static VersionControl VersionControl;

public MyExample()
{
    VersionControl versionControl = MyExample.VersionControl = VersionControl.For(this);
    versionControl.AddVersionReceiver(ReceiveVersion);
}

private static void ReceiveVersion(Version version, PlayerControl player)
{
    if (player == null) return;
    if (version is NoVersion)
    {
        // In my example, we're going to Kick non-modded clients.
        // This can be achieved by returning HandshakeResult.Kick in HandshakeFilter,
        // but I just want an example.
        AmongUsClient.Instance.KickPlayer(player.GetClientId(), false);
    }
}
```

# Custom RPC
For CustomRPCs we will use the `ModRPCAttribute`.<br/>
The ModRPC attribute is the basis for Custom RPCs. This attribute can be put over any method (static or non-static),
and it'll be automatically picked up by the framework for custom rpc use.

> [!Important]
> Non-static methods are only supported in classes implementing type `IRpcInstance`

The following parameters are supported by ModRPC:

* Any native type (bool, int, uint64, string, double, etc.)
* Any type implementing the interface `IRpcSendable`
* Any List<T> where T is any of the above type
* InnerNetObjects (like PlayerControl)
* Additionally, `RpcOptional` parameters are allowed BUT ModRPC does not support ANY ``null`` values passed into the method.

```csharp
public ModRPCAttribute(uint rpc, RpcActors senders, RpcActors receivers, MethodInvocation invocation)
```
- uint rpc: The custom and unique rpc-id to send.
- RpcActors senders: **Default: RpcActors.Everyone** the allowed sender of this RPC.
    - Note: calls to this method from non-allowed senders **ONLY** blocks the RPC from being sent, based on the `MethodInvocation` parameter, this method still may end up running.
- RpcActors receivers: **Default: RpcActors.Everyone** the allowed receiver of this RPC. This rule is handled by the receiving client and NOT the sending client.
- MethodInvocation invocation: If and when the code for the method should be run.
  <br/><br/>

Used in ModRPC attribute to specify allowed senders / receivers of RPC
```csharp
public enum RpcActors
{
    /// Ignores sending / receiving of RPC
    None,
    /// Only allows host to send / receive RPC
    Host,
    /// Permits everyone BUT host to Send / Receive marked RPC
    NonHosts,
    /// Receiver only! Special value which allows for senders to "respond" back to the last client that sent the specific RPC
    LastSender,
    /// Allows any caller to send / receive RPC
    Everyone
}
```

## Example RPC
```csharp
public enum MyRPCs: uint // IMPORANT! (uint)
{
    PublicSendMsg,
    HostSendMsg
}

// Sends / receives a message
[ModRPC((uint)MyRPCs.PublicSendMessage)]
public void AnyoneSendMessage(string message) {
    log.Info($"Message Received: {message}");
}
    
// Allows only host to send a message, and allows for only non-hosts to receive the message
[ModRPC((uint)MyRPCs.HostSendMsg, senders: RpcActors.Host, receivers: RpcActors.NonHost, MethodInvocation.ExecuteBefore]
public void HostMessage(string message) {
    log.Info($"I am not the host and I received this: \"{message}\" message.);
}

AnyoneSendMessage("example"); // Does not send rpc to other clients.
HostMessage("I changed impostor count"); // Sends RPCs to clients AFTER our function runs. If our function gives an error, RPC is never sent.

// Can Also do this:
Vents.FindRPC((uint)MyRPCs.PublicSendMessage).Send(null, "example");
```

# Localization
For localization, you can either use the attribute or manually edit the .yaml file yourself.
`public class LocalizedAttribute : Attribute`

We will be talking about the Attribute.<br/>
Here is a Usage example:
```csharp
using VentLib.Localization.Attributes;

[Localized(nameof(Roles)]
public class Roles
{
    [Localized(nameof(Example)]
    public class Example
    {
        // These values will be automatically converted on game start.
        // It will also be automatically added to your language file.
        [Localized(nameof(RoleName)] public static string RoleName = "Example";
        [Localized(nameof(Description)] public static string Description = "This is an example description.";
    }
}

// There is also a Localizer object.
// It is used when you dont want a class full of translations, and you want to add text manually.
using VentLib.Localization;

Localizer localizer = Localizer.Get(); // You can pass in an Assembly, but it gets the calling one.
localizer.Translate("Roles.Example.RoleName"); // Should return "Example". If it doesnt exist, returns <Roles.Example.RoleName>
```
Please do note that this will only get the string of language set currently, (usually at load time is when you use this).<br/>
You can always postfix `TranslationController.SetLanguage` to update anything necessary. (use a low priority)
